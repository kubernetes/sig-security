# Third-Party Security Audit Subproject - RFP Decision Process

Kubernetes SIG Security's Third-Party Security Audit subproject (subproject, henceforth) runs the process of conducting a third-party security audit for the Kubernetes project.

The subproject is working with the [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF, henceforth)](https://ostif.org/) to create the RFP, evaluate responses to the RFP, and to coordinate with the vendor. Since 2022, the CNCF have been working with OSTIF to conduct security audits for incubating and graduated CNCF projects.
For more background on CNCF’s partnership with OSTIF and security audits, checkout blogs from [2022](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/) and [2023](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/03/13/an-overview-of-the-cncf-and-ostif-impact-report-for-the-second-half-of-2022-and-early-2023/).

The process started with creating the scope of the external security audit. The scope was identified by the subproject and Kubernetes contributors. 
OSTIF and the subproject created the [Request for Proposal (RFP) in 2024](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-external-audit/security-audit-2024/RFP.md) which outlined the scope and goals of the security audit. The RFP closed after receiving seven (7) responses to the RFP.

OSTIF evaluated the RFP responses to determine which vendor to proceed with the audit and reviewed results with the subproject. Scoring was based on the following criteria:
  - Openness
  - Scope
  - Expertise
  - Cost
  - Past performance
  - Documentation quality

Out of a total score of 100, the scores of the RFP responses were:

| Vendor | Total Score|
|--------|------------|
| Vendor A | 92 |
| Vendor B | 73 |
| Vendor C | 90 |
| Vendor D | 100 |
| Vendor E | 0 |
| Vendor F | 86 |
| Vendor G | 0 |

OSTIF and the Kubernetes SIG Security's Third-Party Security Audit subproject selects Shielder to complete the 2025 third-party security audit for the Kubernetes project.

We look forward to working with OSTIF and Shielder on the audit and to partner with various SIGs on this assessment.
