# Self-assessment

A Self-assessment is a great starting point for Kubernetes subprojects to reach a security baseline. Our team 
will work with project maintainers create a threat model and assess the current security stance of all or a portion of 
the project. The resulting assessment will allow maintainers to determine gaps in their project's security and develop a
strategy to work toward improving it.
