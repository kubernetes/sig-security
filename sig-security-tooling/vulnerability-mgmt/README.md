# Vulnerability Management

Covers Kubernetes wide vulnerability management process, policies and workflows
that tackle *known* vulnerabilities in Kubernetes artifacts that can be found
via automation

## Goals

1. Identify known vulnerabilities in Kubernetes artifacts by scanning them
   periodically
2. Leverage the existing resolution and reporting process (i.e. Github issues, PRs)
   to document and resolve any vulnerabilities that impact Kubernetes
3. Create community driven awareness and documentation around known CVEs in
   Kubernetes related artifacts

### Build Time Dependencies

A tool agnostic periodic scanning of build time dependencies
(typically dependencies found in `go.mod` file) of Kubernetes. More details can
be found [here](build-time-dependencies.md)

This track is a partnership between SIG
Architecture's [Code Organization](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture#code-organization)
sub-project and SIG Security's Tooling sub-project

### Container Images

A tool agnostic periodic scanning for vulnerabilities in container images 
shipped as part of a Kubernetes Release. This effort is beginning to take form 
and is being tracked in 
[Issue #5920](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5920). More details can be found [here](container-images.md)

This track is a partnership
between [SIG Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release)
and SIG Security's Tooling sub-project

**Note**: Artifacts here refer to code, images and binaries

## Non-Goals

1. **Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**: This will continue to be the
   responsibility
   of [Security Response Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/committee-product-security/README.md)
2. **Runtime dependencies**: Triaging of vulnerabilities found in components
   that are runtime dependencies for an on-premises or *-as-a-service*
   Kubernetes deployment. Examples include but are not limited to container
   runtimes, container registries, Node OS
3. **Resolving license violations**: Allowed third party license policy can be
   found [here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#approved-licenses-for-allowlist)
4. **Fixing unfixable vulnerabilities**: The focus of this effort is to apply fixes to
vulnerabilities for which a patch is released by owners of the vulnerable dependency
or base image. This scoping decision is made to maximize utilization of maintainer
time and attention span on high impact work.
