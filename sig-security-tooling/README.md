# Welcome to SIG security tooling

Our mission is to enhance the security of Kubernetes through
community-maintained code, often in collaboration with other Special Interest
Groups (SIGs).

We hold meetings every two weeks on Fridays at 4pm UTC ([check your local
time](https://mytime.io/4pm/UTC)), typically alternating between working
sessions and learning sessions. If youâ€™d like to request a learning
session, please [click here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=sig/security&projects=&template=request-learning-session.md&title=REQUEST:+Request+a+Learning+session).
See the history of learning session in the
[learning-sessions.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-tooling/learning-sessions.md) file.
